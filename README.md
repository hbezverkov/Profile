My Public Intro
Hello! I'm Huyen Bezverkov, an aspiring web developer currently transitioning from a rich background in system engineering and biochemical technology. With a Bachelor's in Biochemistry and hands-on experience in software testing and optimization of chemical analyzers, I bring a unique perspective to solving problems in software development.

Passionate about user-centric design and clean, efficient code, I am actively enhancing my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. My goal is to develop intuitive and impactful web applications that leverage my analytical skills and attention to detail, honed through years of scientific and technical testing.

I'm currently working on several projects that combine my interests in science and technology with my new coding skills, which you can find on my GitHub [GitHub Username]. I'm eager to collaborate with other developers and contribute to open source projects that aim to make a difference in people's lives.
